The analogy is generally assessed \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{in the first place on the geopotential field by mean of a comparison of the gradients }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{on gradients of geopotential heights first}\DIFaddend , in order to sample \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{the }\DIFdelend days with a similar atmospheric circulation. \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{Other predictors, such as moisture variables, can also be added in a successive level of analogy.

		The search for candidate situations \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{, }\DIFdelend for a given target day \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{, }\DIFdelend is usually undertaken by comparing the state of the atmosphere at fixed hours of the day \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{, }\DIFdelend for both the target day and the candidate analogues. The \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{constraint being }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{main reason is }\DIFaddend the use of daily \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{time series, }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{precipitation time series }\DIFaddend due to the length of \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{available archives they provide}\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{their available archives}\DIFaddend , and the unavailability of equivalent archives at a finer time step. However, it is unlikely \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{that }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{for }\DIFaddend the best analogy \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{happens }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{to occur }\DIFaddend at the very same hour, \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{but it may }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{while it may be found with a time shift of some hours as it can }\DIFaddend occur at a different time of \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{the }\DIFdelend day. In order to assess the potential \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{of }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{for }\DIFaddend finding better analogues at a different hour, a moving time window (MTW) has been introduced\DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{on a reduced archive of hourly precipitation totals}\DIFdelend .

		The MTW resulted in a better analogy in terms of the atmospheric circulation, with improved values of the analogy \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{criteria on the whole }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{criterion on the entire }\DIFaddend distribution of analogue dates. The improvement was found to grow with the analogue \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{ranks }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{rank }\DIFaddend due to an accumulation of \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{more similar situations }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{better analogues }\DIFaddend in the selection. \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{Moreover, the improvement is even more important for days with heavy precipitation events, which are generally related to more dynamic atmospheric situations, where timing is more specific. 
}%DIFDELCMD <

\DIFdelend A seasonal effect has also been identified, with larger improvements in winter than in summer, supposedly due to \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{the stronger effect of the diurnal cycle in summer , which favors }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{stronger diurnal cycles in summer that favour }\DIFaddend predictors at the same hour for \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{target and analogues}\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{the target and analogue days}\DIFaddend .

		The impact of the MTW on \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{the prediction performance }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{prediction skill }\DIFaddend has been assessed by means of a sub-daily precipitation series transformed into moving \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{24~h-totals at a 6-hourly time step. This resulted in an improvement of the prediction skills, which were even larger }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{24h totals at 6h time steps. The prediction skill was found to have improved by the MTW, and even to a greater extent }\DIFaddend after recalibrating the AM parameters. \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{Moreover, the improvement was greater for days with heavy precipitation, which are generally related to more dynamic atmospheric situations where timing is more specific and which are fewer in the meteorological archive.

		However, \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{attempts to reconstruct longer precipitation series of running 24~h-totals by means of simple methods failed.

	\DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{The Analogue Method (AM) is }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{Analogue methods (AMs) are }\DIFaddend based on the \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{principle }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{hypothesis }\DIFaddend that two relatively similar synoptic situations may produce \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{relatively }\DIFdelend similar local effects \citep{Lorenz1956, Lorenz1969}. \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{They are statistical downscaling methods \mbox{%DIFAUXCMD
\citep{Maraun2010} }%DIFAUXCMD
and consist of finding past situations that are similar to the target day of interest in terms of the atmospheric circulation or other synoptic predictors.

	\DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{The first method }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{The spatial transferability of the method is analysed in \mbox{%DIFAUXCMD
\citet{Chardon2014} }%DIFAUXCMD
and \mbox{%DIFAUXCMD
\citet{Radanovics2013}}%DIFAUXCMD
. A great advantage of AMs is that they create realistic precipitation patterns, since they are based on observed situations with consistent spatial distribution, as long as the analogue dates chosen for a region are the same. Moreover, they can provide multivariate predictions that are physically consistent \mbox{%DIFAUXCMD
\citep{Raynaud2016b}}%DIFAUXCMD
. Their temporal transferability has also been the topic of recent studies for past or future climates \mbox{%DIFAUXCMD
\citep{Dayon2015, Caillouet2016}}%DIFAUXCMD
.
	}

	\DIFadd{The method requires two different archives. The first is a meteorological archive describing the state of the atmosphere at a synoptic scale, such as reanalysis datasets. The second is an archive of the target variable to be forecast, here precipitation. This archive is made of precipitation cumulated over a certain time duration, most often daily but sometimes sub-daily, either at a target station or integrated over a target catchment. Obviously, the period to be used is limited to the smallest period common to the two archives.
	}

	\DIFadd{\mbox{%DIFAUXCMD
\citet{Ruosteenoja1988} }%DIFAUXCMD
and \mbox{%DIFAUXCMD
\citet{Vandendool1994} }%DIFAUXCMD
have analysed the influence of the length of the meteorological archive on the quality of the analogy. They highlighted a three-way relationship between the quality of the analogy, the archive length, and the size of the spatial domain (or degrees of freedom): errors increase with a bigger domain, but decrease with a longer archive. They demonstrated that it is not possible to find good analogues over the whole northern hemisphere with a 100 year archive (and even for much higher orders of magnitude). Hopefully, it appears that for the aim of predicting precipitation over point stations or catchments of some 100 or 1000 km\texttwosuperior, there is no need to consider meteorological domains larger than 10\textdegree\ to 20\textdegree. For that reason, smaller spatial windows are always considered when searching for analogues, and the archive length is maximized. 
	}

	\DIFadd{Therefore, due to the availability of long precipitation archives at a daily time step that have no equivalent at a finer resolution, AMs are usually implemented on a daily basis. Consequently, the analogue situations are assessed by comparing predictors at fixed hours of the day. However, it can be expected that the analogy of the synoptic situations does not occur systematically at the same time of the day and that better candidates can be found by shifting to a different hour. With this assumption, a moving time window (MTW) was introduced to allow the search for candidates at different hours of the day. Previous tests showed the benefit, in terms of analogy criterion values, of searching for analogue synoptic situations at a finer time step, but without assessing the impact on the prediction skill \mbox{%DIFAUXCMD
\citep{Finet2008}}%DIFAUXCMD
.
	}

	\DIFadd{The MTW finds analogue situations at different hours of the day, which can also be seen as an inflation of the archive length. However, despite having $x$ time more candidate situations, the quantity of new information is not expected to be as important as a $x$ time longer archive due to significant correlation between successive situations within the same day. Nevertheless, if the MTW can improve the prediction skill of the AM, it means that it does extract new information from the archive. Therefore, if the reduction of the archive length needed by the MTW, due to the reduced availability of a sub-daily precipitation time series, is expected to decrease the AM performance, the archive inflation brought by the MTW is expected to contribute to an increase in performance.
	}

	\DIFadd{Other possibilities exist for increasing the prediction skill of the AMs. A classical approach is to add new predictors or new successive levels of analogy \mbox{%DIFAUXCMD
\citep[see e.g.][]{Horton2012a, BenDaoud2016, Caillouet2016}}%DIFAUXCMD
. AMs can also be combined with other methods \mbox{%DIFAUXCMD
\citep[see e.g.][]{Chardon2014}}%DIFAUXCMD
. Another possibility is to use a global optimization technique, such as genetic algorithms, in order to better optimize the method and to add new parameters \mbox{%DIFAUXCMD
\citep{Horton2016}}%DIFAUXCMD
. However, the MTW technique is not in competition with other approaches and can be combined with these. Indeed, as most of them rely on the atmospheric circulation in the first level of analogy, the application of a MTW should lead to similar conclusions.
	}

	\DIFadd{Section \ref{sec:data_methods} presents the context of the study as well as the data and methods, including the proposed MTW technique. The impact of the reduction of the archive and the improvements brought by the MTW are assessed in Sect. \ref{sec:results}. The benefits of introducing a MTW were assessed first in regards to the analogy criterion improvement between synoptic situations (Sect. \ref{sec:influence_criteria}) and then in terms of precipitation prediction skill (Sect. \ref{sec:influence_scores}). Finally, the results are discussed in Sect. \ref{sec:discussion}, and the conclusions are found in Sect. \ref{sec:conclusions}.

	\subsection{\DIFadd{Study area and data}}
	\label{sec:data}

	\DIFadd{The study area is the upper Rh\^{o}ne catchment in Switzerland. Precipitation time series come from six automatic weather stations, viz., Ulrichen, Zermatt, Visp, Montana, Sion, and Aigle (Fig. \ref{fig:map}) that are subject to various meteorological influences \mbox{%DIFAUXCMD
\citep{Horton2012}}%DIFAUXCMD
. The data were available at an hourly time step for 25~years (1982\textendash 2007) and were also obtained at a daily time step (from 6:00~UTC to 6:00~UTC the next day) for 47~years (1961\textendash 2008). Due to the low density of weather stations with high temporal resolution and long archives, no spatially aggregated rainfall was processed. The results will hereafter be presented arbitrarily for the Ulrichen station but are equivalent for all stations.
	}

	\DIFadd{Synoptic-scale variables, used as predictors, were extracted from the NCEP/NCAR reanalysis 1 dataset \mbox{%DIFAUXCMD
\citep{Kalnay1996} }%DIFAUXCMD
with a 6h temporal resolution, 17 pressure levels, and a spatial resolution of 2.5\textdegree. This dataset is now relatively old, but it is not expected to affect the conclusions of the present study (see discussion in Sect. \ref{sec:old_reanalysis}).

The }\DIFaddend similarity of the atmospheric circulation of the target date with every day of the preselection is assessed by processing the \citet{Teweles1954} score (\DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{$S_{\text{TW}}$) , which }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{S1) that }\DIFaddend is a comparison of gradients \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{, }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{on geopotential heights }\DIFaddend over a certain spatial window and at certain hours\DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{. The smaller the $S_{\text{TW}}$ }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{:

	\begin{equation}
	\label{eq:S1}

	{\displaystyle \sum_{i}^{m} max( \vert \Delta\hat{z}_{i} \vert , \vert \Delta z_{i} \vert ) }
	\end{equation}
	\DIFadd{where $\Delta \hat{z}_{i}$ is the forecast geopotential height difference between the }\textit{\DIFadd{i}}\DIFadd{th pair of adjacent points from the grid of the target situation, $\Delta z_{i}$ is the corresponding observed geopotential height difference in the candidate situation, and $m$ is the number of pairs of adjacent points in the grid.

\DIFdel{The predictand, here a 24~h precipitation total, results from meteorological situations that are continuous transitions between changing circulation patterns. Thus, the observed predictors fields, }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{there is greater similarity in the pressure fields.

	\DIFadd{The predictor variables }\DIFaddend extracted from reanalysis datasets \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{, }\DIFdelend are considered at different \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{time }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{hours }\DIFaddend of the day\DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{and at different heights.

When adding a second level of analogy, $N_{2}$ dates are subsampled \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{in }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{from }\DIFaddend the $N_{1}$ analogues on the atmospheric circulation, \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{to end up with }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{resulting in }\DIFaddend a smaller number of analogue situations.

This increase in improvement with the analogue rank can be explained by the accumulation of better analogues in the selection, with new better situations pushing previous analogues to higher ranks. The curve representing the minimum improvement is mostly superior to zero, meaning that the criteria have been improved on most analogue ranks for every day of the calibration period. All other stations had a similar improvement in the S1 criterion, both in terms of the distribution shape and amplitude. The introduction of the MTW allows finding }\DIFaddend better analogue situations in the \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{distributions.
	It seems thus profitable to widen }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{first level of analogy, resulting in a selection of days with better similarity in atmospheric circulation.
	}

	\DIFadd{When adding a second level of analogy with moisture variables, the criteria values (RMSE) were not improved by the MTW (Sect. \ref{sec:perf_2Z-2MI}), as the number of candidates was not higher (still the $N_{1}$ days selected in the first level of analogy). However, this result of a globally null improvement of the RMSE values does not mean that the 2Z-2MI method cannot be improved by the MTW. It means that after }\DIFaddend the selection of \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{analogues in order to keep also some whose rank has increased, as they appear to be also relevant to predict precipitation values }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{the analogue situations for the synoptic circulation, the new candidate dates did not provide better analogues in terms of moisture.

For example, when processing forecasts for a target day with synoptic similarity with situations from the past related to extreme weather, even though no precipitation archive is available. Indeed, some of those days with strong precipitation events may be documented, either qualitatively in the daily press or more quantitatively in flood reports. It is thus worth to known that the situation at hand has such analogue in the past. Another possible application is a quality assessment of }\DIFaddend the \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{performance of the different precipitation classes. The same analysis as in Sect. \ref{sec:improvement_CRPSS_precip_threshold} has been performed again on the basis of the newly calibrated parameters.

The change in the analogues numbers is likely to be responsible for this difference in the performance distributions}\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{selection of analogues on a shorter period, where precipitation data with a high temporal resolution is available.

It was in this case of the same magnitude as if the length of the archive doubled.

The likely reason is that an actual longer archive would contain more atmospheric situations that might have been observed less frequently during a shorter period. Moreover, high correlations between sub-daily circulation patterns are expected. The MTW, therefore, did not create 4 times as many independent data, but the increase in information was nevertheless substantial. In this regards, a reanalysis dataset with a higher temporal resolution might not improve the performance significantly more than a 6-hourly dataset. In contrast, reducing the MTW to a 12-hour time step might reduce redundancy in the archive, but might also reduce the chance of finding better analogue situations, as circulation patterns can evolve substantially in 12~hours.

	The \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{AM is }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{AMs are }\DIFaddend most often based on a daily time step \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{, }\DIFdelend due to the availability of long precipitation archives. However, it is unlikely that two analogue synoptic situations, that evolve relatively quickly, would correspond optimally at the same \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{hour }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{hours }\DIFaddend of the day. It is \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{thus more likely that a better match }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{probable that better matches }\DIFaddend can be found at another time, which can change the selection of the \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{analogues }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{analogue }\DIFaddend dates.

	As \citet{Finet2008} had previously shown, the introduction of a MTW allows finding better analogue situations in terms of the atmospheric circulation. It has been \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{here demonstrated }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{demonstrated in this study }\DIFaddend that the improvement of the \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{$S_{\text{TW}}$ criteria values is }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{S1 criterion values was }\DIFaddend growing with the rank of the analogue. This \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{is }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{was }\DIFaddend due to the accumulation of better analogues within the predicted distributions.

	The improvement of the circulation analogy was found to be more important for \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{heavy precipitationevents}\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{days with heavier precipitation}\DIFaddend , which are generally related to more dynamic atmospheric situations \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{. This dynamism implies }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{and are less frequent in the archive. These situations have }\DIFaddend more specific circulation patterns that are evolving more rapidly. \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{Thus}\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{Therefore}\DIFaddend , a MTW \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{is }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{was }\DIFaddend found to be of particular interest in this kind of situation, \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{and benefits }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{benefiting }\DIFaddend the prediction of \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{extreme }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{heavier }\DIFaddend precipitation events.

	A seasonal effect has been highlighted, as the MTW \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{is }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{was }\DIFaddend more profitable for winter \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{months }\DIFdelend than summer. The reason is likely that the diurnal cycle has a bigger effect in summer than in winter \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{, }\DIFdelend which results in better analogues at the same time of the day. The preference for the same hours in summer has been demonstrated\DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{, whereas}\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{; whereas, }\DIFaddend 75\DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{~}\DIFaddend \% of the analogue situations \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{are }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{were }\DIFaddend selected at a different time in winter.

	The impact of the MTW on the prediction \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{performance has never been assessed before , }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{skill was never assessed before }\DIFaddend due to the shortcoming of long precipitation series at a sub-daily time step. \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{The impact of the MTW approach could be assessed on }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{Here, it was assessed for }\DIFaddend a 25\DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{years }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{~year }\DIFaddend time series with a high temporal resolution. After the introduction of the MTW, the performance scores increased of the same \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{order of }\DIFdelend magnitude as if the length of the archive doubled\DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{, in this case study}\DIFdelend .

	The parameters were then calibrated again, using the MTW. Some parameters changed, \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{with }\DIFaddend the main difference being the number of analogues, which systematically and significantly increased compared to the original set. A wider selection of analogue situations, containing those whose rank decreased, seemed \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{profitable }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{beneficial }\DIFaddend for the prediction performance. The number of good analogues \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{is thus globally increased }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{was globally increased in the same way as if the archive length increased}\DIFaddend . This change seems to benefit \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{mainly }\DIFdelend the prediction of days with small precipitation totals.

	The importance of the quality of the precipitation archive was also demonstrated, as \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{too }\DIFdelend simplistic reconstructions of 6-hourly time series \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{lead }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{led }\DIFaddend to a loss of all the improvement brought by \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{better analogue situations identified by }\DIFdelend the MTW. The precipitation prediction is improved only when the precipitation chronology is close to the accurate one. Attempts to reconstruct longer time series based on \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{a simplistic proportional distribution or }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{simplistic proportional distributions or by }\DIFaddend using meteorological variables from the NCEP reanalysis 1 dataset as proxy did not succeed. Other reanalysis datasets \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{could eventually preform }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{with more accurate moisture variables could eventually perform }\DIFaddend better.

	\DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{Perspectives of using the MTW rely }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{The use of the MTW relies partly }\DIFaddend on the availability of long precipitation series at a sub-daily time step and with high accuracy. \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{The first source of such data is the simple fact that with time}\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{First}\DIFaddend , these archives of high temporal resolution precipitation data are \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{getting longer. The second source }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{increasing over time. Another possible source of such archives }\DIFaddend is the establishment of precipitation reanalysis at a \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{country scale , }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{regional scale }\DIFaddend or the use of reanalysis-driven \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{RCMs (Regional Climate Models) or LAMs (Limited Area Models) on }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{regional climate models or limited area models over }\DIFaddend a long period. \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{When such precipitation data will be }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{Even though outputs from these models might be biased or not accurate enough, information regarding the timing of the precipitation events could be useful in disaggregating the station time series.
	}

	\DIFadd{Finally, since long meteorological archives (reanalysis datasets) are more and more }\DIFaddend available, the \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{use of a }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{improvements proposed by the MTW especially for days with heavy precipitation may be interesting even without long continuous precipitation archives. For example, recent target day may have synoptic similarity with situations from the early twentieth century, for which no continuous daily precipitation archive is available. However, some of those days with strong precipitation events may be documented, either qualitatively in the daily press or more quantitatively in flood reports. Nevertheless, it is worth to known that the situation at hand has such analogue in the far past.
	}

	\DIFadd{The use of the }\DIFaddend MTW in the AM \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{should be considered for any application, especially when the prediction quality of extreme events is important}\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{can already be considered now for several applications in different contexts, may it be for operational forecasting or climate-related studies}\DIFaddend .
