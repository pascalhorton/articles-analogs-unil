\begin{abstract}
The Analogue Method (AM) aims at forecasting local weather variables (predictands), such as the precipitation, by means of a statistical relationship with predictors at a synoptic scale. The analogy is assessed in the first place on the geopotential field by mean of a comparison of the gradients, in order to sample the days with a similar atmospheric circulation. 

The search for candidates situations, for a given target day, is usually undertaken by comparing the state of the atmosphere at fixed hours of the day. The constraint being the use of daily time series, due to the length of available archives they provide. However, it is unlikely that the best analogues happen at the very same hour, but may occur at different time of the day. In order to assess the potential of finding better analogues at a different times, a sliding time window (STW) has been introduced.

The STW resulted in a better analogy of the atmospheric circulation, with improved values of the analogy criteria on the whole distribution of analogue dates. The improvement was found to grow with the analogue ranks due to an accumulation of more similar situations in the predicted distribution. Moreover, the improvement is even more important for days with heavy precipitation events, which are generally related to more dynamic atmospheric situations, where timing is more specific. 

A seasonal effect has also been identified, with larger improvements in winter that in summer, supposedly due to the stronger effect of the diurnal cycle in summer, which favors predictors at the same hours.

The impact of the STW on the prediction performance has been assessed by means of a sub-daily precipitation series transformed into moving 24~h-totals at a 6-hourly time step. This resulted in an improvement of the prediction skills, which were even larger after recalibrating the AM parameters.

Attempts to reconstruct longer precipitation series of running 24~h-totals by means of simple methods failed. It empathized the need to use time series with an accurate chronology. These should be available in a near future, either by means of growing observed time series, or by the establishment of precipitation reanalysis through regional modeling. Then, the use of a STW in the AM should be considered for any application, especially when the prediction quality of extreme events is important.

\introduction  %% \introduction[modified heading if necessary]

The Analogue Method (AM) is based on the principle that two relatively similar synoptic situations may produce relatively similar local effects, and can be called analogues \citep{Lorenz1956, Lorenz1969}. Multiple variations of the methods exist and listings can be found in \citet{Horton2016} or \citet{BenDaoud2015}. The versions that will be considered here are often used as references or benchmarks for various improvements. The first implementation relies on an analogy of the atmospheric circulation, and the other adds a second level of analogy on moisture variables \citep{Obled2002, Bontron2005, Marty2012}.

The first method is based on the analogy of the synoptic circulation (Table \ref{table:method_2Z}). When searching analogue situations for a target day, it starts by a preselection step, which is a selection of the 4 months centered around the target date for every year of the archive, in order to cope with seasonal effects. Then, the similarity of the atmospheric circulation of a target date with every day of the preselection is assessed by processing the S1 criteria \citep[Eq.\ \ref{eq:S1}, ][]{Teweles1954, Drosdowsky2003}, which is a comparison of gradients, over a certain spatial window. The considered pressure levels are 500~hPa (Z500) and 1000~hPa (Z1000) \citep{Bontron2005}. The $N_{1}$ dates, which is a parameter to calibrate, with the lowest values of S1 are considered as analogues to the target day. Then, the daily observed precipitation amount of the corresponding dates provide the empirical conditional distribution considered as the probabilistic forecast for the target day. Following the nomenclature proposed by \citet{Horton2016}, this method will be named 2Z.

\begin{equation}
\label{eq:S1}
S1=100 \frac {\displaystyle \sum_{i} \vert \Delta\hat{z}_{i} - \Delta z_{i} \vert}
{\displaystyle \sum_{i} max\left\lbrace \vert \Delta\hat{z}_{i} \vert , \vert \Delta z_{i} \vert \right\rbrace }
\end{equation}
where $\Delta \hat{z}_{i}$ is the forecast geopotential height difference between the \textit{i}th pair of adjacent points of the gridded data describing the target situation, and $\Delta z_{i}$ is the corresponding observed geopotential height difference in the candidate situation. The differences are processed separately in both directions. The smaller the S1 values, the more similar the pressure fields.

The second reference method adds a subsequent level of analogy on moisture variables (method 2Z-2MI, Table \ref{table:method_2Z-2MI}). This second predictor is a moisture index made of the product of the total precipitable water (TPW) with the relative humidity at 850~hPa (RH850) \citep{Bontron2004}. When adding a second level of analogy, $N_{2}$ dates are subsampled in the $N_{1}$ analogues on the atmospheric circulation, to end up with a smaller number of analogue situations. When a second level of analogy is added, a higher number of $N_{1}$ analogues is kept on the first level.

To calibrate the method, the commonly used technique is a semi-automatic sequential procedure elaborated by \citet{Bontron2004}. AtmoSwing \citep{Horton2016}, which implements this technique was used in order to calibrate the parameters in the present study. The score that is most often used to assess an AM performance is the CRPS \citep[Continuous Ranked Probability Score,][]{Brown1974, Matheson1976, Hersbach2000}. It allows evaluating the predicted cumulative distribution functions $F(y)$, for example of the precipitation values $y$ from analogue situations, compared to the observed value $y^{0}$. The better the forecast, the smaller the score. The mean CRPS of a forecast series of length $n$ can be written:

\begin{equation}
\label{eq:CRPS}
CRPS = \frac{1}{n} \sum_{i=1}^{n} \left(  \int_{-\infty}^{+\infty} \left[ F_{i}(y)-H_{i}(y-y_{i}^{0})\right]^{2} dy \right) 
\end{equation}
where $H(y-y_{i}^{0})$ is the Heaviside function that is null when $y-y_{i}^{0}<0$, and has the value 1 otherwise. The mean CRPS is averaged on the calibration, respectively the validation periods, on all days. \citet{Bontron2004} proposed a decomposition of this score into a sharpness and an accuracy terms.

In order to compare the value of the score in regard to a reference, one often considers its skill score expression, and use the climatological distribution as the reference. The CRPSS (\textit{Continuous Ranked Probability Skill Score}) is thus defined as following:

\begin{equation}
\label{eq:CRPSS}
CRPSS = \frac{CRPS-CRPS_{r}}{CRPS_{p}-CRPS_{r}} = 1-\frac{CRPS}{CRPS_{r}}
\end{equation}
where $CRPS_{r}$ is the CRPS value for the reference and $CRPS_{p}$ would be the one for a perfect forecast (which implies $CRPS_{p}~=~0$). A better forecast is characterized by an increase in CRPSS. 

The AM is usually implemented with a daily time step, due to the availability of long precipitation archives that have no equivalent to a finer resolution. Therefore, the analogues situations are assessed on the basis of a daily time step, by comparing predictors at fixed hours of the day, otherwise one would not know what precipitation values to assign to them. However, it can be expected that the analogy of the synoptic situations do not occur systematically at the same time of the day, and that better candidates can be found at different times. On this assumption, a sliding time window (STW) was introduced to allow searching for candidates at different hours of the day.

Previous tests showed the benefit, in terms of analogy criteria values, of searching for analogue synoptic situations at a finer time step, but without assessing the impact on the forecast skills \citep{Finet2008}. In order to assess this potential improvement of the prediction, precipitation data with a resolution of 10 minutes on a respectable archive length was used (section \ref{sec:data}). It was then aggregated in the form of 24~h totals, but at a 6-hourly time step, by means of a moving average (section \ref{sec:method}).

One can question the interest of using daily totals when a 6-hourly precipitation series can be used. The first reason is that the 6-hourly time series generated by the AM may not represent well the dynamic of the accurate precipitation (results not shown), due to a smoothed signal. Then, sometimes one just does not need finer resolution than the daily time step. Finally, when using a reconstructed precipitation archive, the errors in intra-day precipitation distributions have a lesser impact.


\section{Study area and data}
\label{sec:data}

The study area is the upper Rh\^{o}ne catchment in Switzerland \cite[study area of][]{Horton2012a}. Due to the low density of weather stations with high temporal resolution and long archives, no aggregation or catchment rainfall was processed. The time series (on the period 1982-2007) come from 6 automatic weather stations, namely Ulrichen, Zermatt, Visp, Montana, Sion and Aigle, which are subject to various meteorological influences \citep{Horton2012}. The results will thereafter be presented arbitrarily for the Ulrichen station, but they are equivalent for all stations.

Predictors are extracted from the NCEP/NCAR reanalysis I \citep{Kalnay1996} dataset with a 6-hourly temporal resolution, 17 pressure levels, and a spatial resolution of 2.5\degree.

\section{The sliding time window (STW) approach}
\label{sec:method}

In order to assess the benefit of searching analogue situations at a sub-daily time step, an appropriate time series is required. On the basis of high resolution time series (section \ref{sec:data}), 24~h totals were processed, but at a 6-hourly time step (temporal resolution of the reanalysis dataset), by means of a moving average. 

The target situations and their corresponding observed precipitation values (used for validation) do not change, because the forecast is always established for a fixed period of the target day (6-30~h), as before. The difference is that the candidates are 4~times more numerous (Figure \ref{fig:principle}).

\begin{figure}[htb]
	\begin{center}
		\includegraphics[width=8.3cm]{figures/illustration_moving_window.pdf}
	\end{center}
	\caption{Illustration of the principle of a sliding time window. }
	\label{fig:principle}
\end{figure}

Logic suggests a priori that only one situation (the best) is selected per candidate day. An exclusion of the same dates was tested in two different ways: (1)
by excluding the worse analogues in a period of $\pm$ 24~h, and (2) by excluding the worse analogues with the same date. After several tests, it turned out that no restrictions led to better skills, and this on a significant and recurring basis. Thus, no constraint was further used.


\section{Consequences of the archive reduction}

As sub-daily precipitation time series are usually available on a shorter period than traditional daily time steps, the first assessment consists in assessing the loss of performance resulting from a reduction a 47~years archive (1961 to 2008) to 25~years (1982 to 2007). This change is assessed with the original method, without STW.

Both 2Z (Table \ref{table:method_2Z}) and 2Z-2MI (Table \ref{table:method_2Z-2MI}) methods were considered. The AM parameters were calibrated using AtmoSwing \citep{Horton2016} on the original archive (Tables \ref{table:method_2Z} and \ref{table:method_2Z-2MI}) and will be used thereafter.

\end{table}

The impact of the change in the archive length is summarized in Table \ref{table:loss_reduction} for both 2Z and 2Z-2MI methods. As expected, a loss of performance can be observed for each station, except for that of Aigle, which seems relatively indifferent to this change. This loss is globally significant, with up to -1.89 points for Visp and the 2Z method. 


\section{Influence on the analogy criteria}

\subsection{Changes in the atmospheric circulation analogy}

When searching for analogues on the geopotential heights, as in the 2Z method, there are now 4 times more candidates than before, which obviously allows to find better matches.

\begin{figure*}[htb]
	\begin{center}
		\includegraphics[width=15cm]{figures/changes_S1_analogues.png}
	\end{center}
	\caption{Changes in the S1 criteria distributions of the $1^{st}$, $5^{th}$, $20^{th}$ and $40^{th}$ analogue ranks for the Ulrichen station, due to the STW.}
	\label{fig:changes_S1_analogues}
\end{figure*}

Figure \ref{fig:changes_S1_analogues} presents the changes in the distributions of the S1 criterion for the $1^{st}$, $5^{th}$, $20^{th}$ and $40^{th}$ analogues for the Ulrichen station on the whole calibration period, due to introduction of the STW. The precipitation target remains at before, that is centered on 18~h~UTC (6~h~UTC to 6~h~UTC the next day). The shapes of the distributions of the conventional approach and the STW are similar, but the values of the analogy criteria are now reduced, therefore better. An increase in the difference between a fixed window and a sliding window is identifiable, which means that the last analogues are further improved. The latter effect is due to the accumulation of improvements brought by the new analogue situations in the selection.

\begin{figure}[htb]
	\begin{center}
		\includegraphics[width=8.2cm]{figures/changes_S1_value.pdf} \\
		\includegraphics[width=8.3cm]{figures/changes_S1_gain.pdf}
	\end{center}
	\caption{Synthesis of the changes in the S1 criteria, due to the STW, for the Ulrichen station, depending on the ranks of the analogue. (top) Quantiles of the S1 distributions with and without the STW. (bottom) Quantiles of the relative improvements of the S1 criteria when using the STW.}
	\label{fig:changes_S1}
\end{figure}

The improvements of the S1 criteria are summarized in Figure \ref{fig:changes_S1}, which shows (top) quantiles of the S1 criteria according to the analogue rank for the conventional method and the STW, and (bottom) quantiles of the relative reduction. This confirms that all quantile seem similarly reduced (S1 distributions keep their shape), and that this improvement is constantly increasing from the first to the last analogue (Figure \ref{fig:changes_S1} bottom).

The median of the S1 values reduction (Figure \ref{fig:changes_S1} bottom) starts approximately at 5~\% for the first analogue and reaches more than 10~\% for the last. This increasing trend with the analogue rank can be explained by the accumulation of better analogues in the distribution. The minimum improvement starts from 0 and reaches 2-3\%, meaning that the criteria has been improved for all analogue ranks of the distribution end. All other stations have a similar improvement of the S1 criteria, both in terms of distribution shape and amplitude.


\subsection{Influence of the weather situation}
\label{sec:influence_precip}

It can be assumed that the atmospheric conditions with a low dynamism, such as the frequent anticyclonic situations, will not be radically improved by the introduction of the STW. Conversely, dynamic situations, such as weather disturbances, have a well marked temporal evolution. Indeed, the position of the driving elements such as the low-pressure area and the fronts change significantly during a day. We can therefore expect to improve particularly these situations with a higher dynamism when introducing a STW, as better matches to the target situation may be found.

The dynamism of a given atmospheric condition cannot be easily quantified. A basic assumption is considered here, which stipulates that the more a day is rainy, the more dynamic the situation is. The results of this analysis are summarized in Figure \ref{fig:changes_S1_precip_threshold} by the median reduction of S1 for days with precipitation between two thresholds. The number of analogues being reduced, the curves are not as smooth as in previous analyzes. It is nevertheless clear that the improvement tends to increase on days with higher precipitation. This is true for all our stations and confirms our intuition.

		\includegraphics[width=8.3cm]{figures/changes_S1_precip_threshold.pdf}
	\end{center}
	\caption{Distribution of the median improvements of the S1 criteria, due to the STW, depending on precipitation thresholds at the Ulrichen station.}
	\label{fig:changes_S1_precip_threshold}
\end{figure}


\subsection{Seasonal effect}
\label{sec:seasonal_effect}

Atmospheric dynamics varies greatly from one season to another, which reflects on the performance of the AM that is generally lower between June and August \citep{Bliefernicht2010}. It therefore makes sense to verify the effect of the STW separately per season.

\begin{figure}[htb]
	\begin{center}
		\includegraphics[width=7cm]{figures/changes_S1_seasons.pdf}
	\end{center}
	\caption{Seasonal effect on the median reduction of the S1 criteria for the Ulrichen station due to the STW. DJF: winter, MAM: spring, JJA: summer SON: fall.}
	\label{fig:changes_S1_seasons}
\end{figure}

\begin{figure}[htb]
	\includegraphics[width=8.3cm]{figures/hours_selection_per_season.pdf}
	\caption{Distribution of the predictors hours in the selected analogue dates depending on the season, for the Ulrichen station.}
	\label{fig:hours_selection_per_season}
\end{figure}

A seasonal effect can be observed on the reduction of the S1 criteria due to the STW (Figure \ref{fig:changes_S1_seasons}). The improvements are greater for winter than summer. One hypothesis is that the diurnal effects of the summer months have an influence on the atmospheric circulation, at least in the lower layers. This effect is based on the daily cycle and good analogues for the same hours are already selected.

An analysis of the selected hours for the geopotential predictor seems to confirm this assumption (Figure \ref{fig:hours_selection_per_season}). It was found that the new choice of the temporal window in winter, when using the STW approach, is well balanced between the 4 options. This means a change of 75\% of the analogues selection compared to the conventional approach, which improves the circulation analogy.

On the contrary, the summer months have a preference for the initial temporal window (Z500 24h \& Z1000 12h), due to more pronounced diurnal effects which reduces the potential for improvement of the criteria. Other seasons are between these two extremes, which is consistent with their respective improvements. This seasonal effect was observed for each station in a very similar way, and generally even with a larger amplitude than for Ulrichen.


\subsection{Changes in the moisture analogy}

When considering the second level of analogy of the 2Z-2MI method (Table \ref{table:method_2Z-2MI}), the candidates situations are not more numerous, as they are subsampled in the previously $N_{1}$ selected analogues, but the dates may have changed. In contrast to earlier, both a reduction and an increase of the RMSE criterion values are possible. Figure \ref{fig:changes_RMSE} shows an almost insignificant improvement of the RMSE values. Unlike for the first level of analogy, the relative improvement of the RMSE values are distributed relatively symmetrically around zero, with improvements and losses of the same amplitude. Once again, the results for the other stations are similar.

\begin{figure}[htb]
	\begin{center}
		\includegraphics[width=8.1cm]{figures/changes_RMSE_value.pdf} \\
		\includegraphics[width=8.3cm]{figures/changes_RMSE_gain.pdf}
	\end{center}
	\caption{Synthesis of the changes in the RMSE criteria, due to the STW, for the Ulrichen station, depending on the ranks of the analogue. (top) Quantiles of the RMSE distributions with and without the STW. (bottom) Quantiles of the relative improvements of the RMSE criteria when using the STW.}
	\label{fig:changes_RMSE}

This result of a globally null improvement of the RMSE values does not mean that the 2Z-2MI method cannot be improved by the STW. It means that after the selection of the analogues situations in terms of the synoptic circulation, the new candidate dates do not allow to find better analogues in terms of moisture. However, the selected dates have changed in the first level of analogy, and thus also in the final selection, which can potentially improve the performance scores.


\section{Impact on performance scores}

A systematic improvement of the S1 values was previously observed. However, finding better analogue situations does not obligatory imply better forecast skills. Therefore, the impact of the introduction of the STW, and thus the selection of other analogue dates, has to be assessed on the performance scores. In order to perform this assessment, the 24~h-totals (moving average) at a 6-hourly time step were used (see section \ref{sec:data}). The target dates remain unchanged, since the original time slot (6~h~UTC - 6~h~UTC the next day) is kept, and thus the performance scores can be directly compared with the former ones.

The new performance scores are provided in Table \ref{table:CRPSS_STW}, along with the differences regarding the conventional method with the same archive length. The differences ranges from 0.57 to 2.14 points for the 2Z method and from 1.53 to 2.20 points for the 2Z-2MI method. The introduction of the STW brings an improvement of the performance that is not very large, but that is nevertheless significant. Moreover, it requires no additional predictor. No relationship was found between the improvement of the score and the reduction of the S1 criteria, neither with the season.

\subsection{Improvement by precipitation threshold}
\label{sec:improvement_CRPSS_precip_threshold}

The S1 criteria was previously found to be improved to a greater extent for the most dynamic situations related with higher precipitation values (section \ref{sec:influence_precip}). The changes in terms of performance scores will now be assessed regarding precipitation thresholds. Figure \ref{fig:changes_CRPS_precip_threshold} synthesizes these differences for the Ulrichen station, other stations having the same behavior.

The increasing positive trend of skill improvements regarding the precipitation threshold is significant and shows that the prediction of higher precipitation totals is further improved. Thus both the analogy criteria and the performance scores are improved to a greater extent for heavier precipitation events. On the contrary, the non-rainy days and small accumulations are not improved.

\subsection{Recalibrating the parameters}
\label{sec:recalibration}

The previous assessment of the performance improvement was established with the original parameters. However, one can assume that the introduction of the STW may change the optimum of some parameters. The calibration has then been performed again.

		\end{tabular}
	\end{center}
	\label{table:params_2Z-2MI_new}
\end{table}

After recalibrating, some changes in the optimal parameters can be observed for both 2Z (Table \ref{table:params_2Z_new}) and 2Z-2MI methods (Table \ref{table:params_2Z-2MI_new}). Among these, the east-west dimension of the spatial windows of the circulation analogy tends to decrease. More significantly, the optimal number of analogues increases after introducing the STW, of a significant order of magnitude: 25~\% to 83~\% for the 2Z method and 20~\% 67~\% for the 2Z-2MI method. The number of analogues of the first analogy level of the 2Z-2MI method even reached three times its previous value for the Visp station. As we saw in Figure \ref{fig:changes_S1}, the improvement of the S1 criteria grows along with the rank of the analogue, which shows an accumulation of better analogue situations in the distributions. It seems thus profitable to widen the selection of analogues in order to keep also some whose rank has increased, as they appear to be also relevant to predict precipitation values. The number of good analogues is thus globally increased.

This increase in number of analogues has a slight effect on the performance of the different precipitation classes. The same analysis as in section \ref{sec:improvement_CRPSS_precip_threshold} has been performed again on the basis of the newly calibrated parameters. The results are generally very similar, but a slight performance increase of small precipitation values can be observed at the expense of higher amounts. The change in the analogues numbers is likely to be responsible for this difference in the performance distributions.

	\end{center}
	\label{table:CRPSS_recalibration}
\end{table}

The values of the CRPSS scores for both methods (Table \ref{table:CRPSS_recalibration}) have significantly increased after recalibration. With the introduction of the STW, the performance loss related to the reduction of the archive length is retrieved. In our case, this improvement is approximately a doubling of the archive size.


\subsection{Changes in sharpness and accuracy}

The CRPS score can be decomposed into two components, namely sharpness and accuracy. The impact of the STW has been analyzed on these components and the results can be found in Table \ref{table:CRPSS_decomposition_no_recalibration} for the original parameters and in Table \ref{table:CRPSS_decomposition_recalibration} for the re-calibrated methods. The changes are expressed relative to the total CRPS. Both components do not have the same value ranges: accuracy is in our case almost twice the sharpness values. Since the CRPS is considered here and not the CRPSS, improved prediction capacity results in a lower score. A decrease of the score is thus desirable.

	\label{fig:CRPSS_decomposition_precip_thresholds}
\end{figure*}

It appears that the sharpness is a bit inferior with the STW in favor of accuracy (Table \ref{table:CRPSS_decomposition_no_recalibration}). When using the recalibrated parameters, the components are a bit more balanced, but still the accuracy prevails on the sharpness (Table \ref{table:CRPSS_decomposition_recalibration}). Figure \ref{fig:CRPSS_decomposition_precip_thresholds} illustrates the changes (relative to the total CRPS) in sharpness and accuracy for different precipitation thresholds at the Ulrichen station. Be it for the 2Z or 2Z-2MI method, the original or the recalibrated parameters, the changes are similar: the improvements concern the accuracy over the sharpness, and this to a greater extent for significant precipitation events. The STW does not allow to improve the sharpness, but the improvement in accuracy is significant, and this especially for the days with heavy precipitation. In terms of the predicted precipitation distribution, it means that the median of the prediction is closer to the observed values, but the distribution is not more condensed than previously.


\section{Application attempts on the full archive}

The improvement provided by the STW is interesting, mainly for heavy precipitation events, and thus it would be profitable to be able to apply it to the complete archive. Unfortunately, there is no long precipitation time series available with a sub-daily time step. In order to reconstruct a longer archive of moving averages of 24~h-totals, different disaggregation approaches of the daily time series were assessed and are presented in the following sections.

\subsection{Proportional distribution}

A proportional distribution is certainly the simplest approach that can be performed. It consists in allocating proportional parts of the original daily time series into a new moving average of 24~h-totals (Figure \ref{fig:illustration_disaggregation}). When using this reconstructed time series on the shorter period, the method performance was degraded (Table \ref{table:disaggregation_proportional} to compare to Table \ref{table:CRPSS_STW}) and was even below the conventional method without STW (Table \ref{table:loss_reduction}). The benefit of a better selection of the analogue situations is lost due to a precipitation archive of poor quality.

\end{table}


\subsection{Use of a proxy variable}

As demonstrated in the previous section, the performance improvement brought by the STW is lost when using a simplistic precipitation time series. In order to get closer to the chronology of the accurate precipitation, the reconstruction procedure must rely on some informative variable. Data from the NCEP/NCAR reanalysis 1 (section \ref{sec:data}) was used in this perspective, despite their rough resolution. 

The first step consisted in determining which variables from the precipitable water or the relative humidity (at 1000~hPa, 925~hPa or 850~hPa) produces the precipitation chronology that is the most correlated (on non-zero values) with the accurate 6-hourly precipitation time series on the period 1982-2007. The location of the most predictive point from the reanalysis grid had to be assessed (closest points: 5\textdegree\~-~7.5\textdegree\ longitude and 45\textdegree\~-~47.5\textdegree\ latitude), as well an eventual time lapse between both series, due to the significant distance separating the weather stations and the reanalysis grid point. The most relevant point will probably not be the same for all stations, since one can expect to find the optimum in the direction of the main moisture inflows for the station. This assessment must be carried out for each station.

The results of the correlation analyses (on non-zero values) between the new series reconstituted using the proxy and the actual series are illustrated in Table \ref{table:proxy_correlations} for Zermatt (on the short period, 1982-2007). The best proxy is the precipitable water at 45\textdegree\ latitude and 7.5\textdegree\ longitude, with a time offset of -6~h. The determination coefficient of 0.721 is higher than that of the series from the proportional distribution (0.698), which confirms that a little information was added to the series of precipitation.

Table \ref{table:proxy_CRPSS} presents the CRPSS scores obtained by the reconstituted series using the proxy of precipitable water at the optimal point (Table \ref{table:proxy_correlations}). A slight improvement can be obtained compared to the proportional distribution method, but it is still relatively small, and most of the benefit of the STW is lost.

These attempts to transpose the STW on the total archive highlight the importance of the actual chronology of rainfall. The STW is profitable, provided that the precipitation series are close to the observed one. Without precipitation series with an accurate sub-daily chronology, the introduction of a STW is not appropriate.


\conclusions  %% \conclusions[modified heading if necessary]

The AM is most often based on a daily time step, due to the availability of long precipitation archives. However, it is unlikely that two analogue synoptic situations, that evolve relatively quickly, would correspond optimally at the same hour of the day. It is thus more likely that a better match can be found at another time, which can change the selection of the analogues dates.

As \citet{Finet2008} had previously shown, the introduction of a STW allows finding better analogue situations in terms of the atmospheric circulation. It has been here demonstrated that the improvement of the S1 criteria values is growing with the rank of the analogue. This is due to the accumulation of better analogues within the predicted distributions.

The improvement of the circulation analogy was found to be more important for heavy precipitation events, which are generally related to more dynamic atmospheric situations. This dynamism implies more specific circulation patterns that are evolving more rapidly. Thus, a STW is found to be of particular interest in this kind of situation, and benefits the prediction of extreme precipitation events.

A seasonal effect has been highlighted, as the STW is more profitable for winter months than summer. The reason is likely that the diurnal cycle has a bigger effect in summer than in winter, which results in better analogues at the same time of the day. The preference for the same hours in summer has been demonstrated, whereas 75\% of the analogue situations are selected at a different time in winter.

The impact of the STW on the prediction performance has never been assessed before, due to the shortcoming of long precipitation series at a sub-daily time step. The impact of the STW approach could be assessed on a 25 years time series with a high temporal resolution. After the introduction of the STW, the performance scores increased of the same order of magnitude as if the length of the archive doubled, in this case study.

The parameters were then calibrated again, using the STW. Some parameters changed, the main difference being the number of analogues that was found optimal, which systematically and significantly increased compared to the original set. A wider selection of analogue situations, containing those whose rank decreased, seemed profitable for the prediction performance. The number of good analogues is thus globally increased. This change seems to benefit mainly the prediction of days with small precipitation totals.

The importance of the quality of the precipitation archive was also demonstrated, as too simplistic reconstructions of 6-hourly time series lead to a loss of all the improvement brought by better analogue situations identified by the STW. The precipitation prediction is improved only when the precipitation chronology is close to the accurate one. Attempts to reconstruct longer time series based on a simplistic proportional distribution or using meteorological variables from the NCEP reanalysis 1 dataset as proxy did not succeed.

Perspectives of using the STW rely on the availability of long precipitation series at a sub-daily time step and with high accuracy. The first source of such data is the simple fact that with time, these archives of high temporal resolution precipitation data are getting longer. The second source is the establishment of precipitation reanalysis at a country scale, or the use of reanalysis-driven RCMs (Regional Climate Models) or LAMs (Limited Area Models) on a long period. When such precipitation data will be available, the use of a STW in the AM should be considered for any application, especially when the prediction quality of extreme events is important.
