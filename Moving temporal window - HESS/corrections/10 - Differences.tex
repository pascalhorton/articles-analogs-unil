		Analogue methods (AMs) predict local weather variables (predictands) \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{, }\DIFdelend such as precipitation \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{, }\DIFdelend by means of a statistical relationship with predictors at a synoptic scale. The analogy is generally assessed on gradients of geopotential heights first \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{, in order }\DIFdelend to sample days with a similar atmospheric circulation. Other predictors \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{, }\DIFdelend such as moisture variables \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{, }\DIFdelend can also be added in a successive level of analogy.

		The search for candidate situations \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{for }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{similar to }\DIFaddend a given target day is usually undertaken by comparing the state of the atmosphere at fixed hours of the day for both the target day and the candidate analogues. \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{The main reason is the use of }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{This is a consequence of using standard }\DIFaddend daily precipitation time series\DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{due to the length of their available archives, and the unavailability of equivalent archives at a finer time step}\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{, which are available over longer periods than sub-daily data}\DIFaddend . However, it is unlikely for the best analogy to occur at the \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{very same hour , while it }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{exact same hour for the target and candidate situations. A better analogue situation }\DIFaddend may be found with a time shift of \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{some hours as it }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{several hours since a better fit }\DIFaddend can occur at \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{a different time of }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{different times of the }\DIFaddend day. In order to assess the potential for finding better analogues at a different hour, a moving time window (MTW) has been introduced.

		The MTW resulted in a better analogy in terms of the atmospheric circulation \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{, with }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{and showed }\DIFaddend improved values of the analogy criterion on the entire distribution of \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{the extracted }\DIFaddend analogue dates. The improvement was found to \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{grow }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{increase }\DIFaddend with the analogue rank \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{due }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{owing }\DIFaddend to an accumulation of better analogues in the selection. A seasonal effect has also been identified, with larger improvements \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{shown }\DIFaddend in winter than in summer\DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{, supposedly due }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{. This may be attributed }\DIFaddend to stronger diurnal cycles in summer that favour predictors \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{taken }\DIFaddend at the same hour for the target and analogue days.

		The impact of the MTW on \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{the precipitation }\DIFaddend prediction skill has been assessed by means of a sub-daily precipitation series transformed into moving \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{24h totals at 6h }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{24 h totals at 12-h, 6-h, and 3-h }\DIFaddend time steps. The prediction skill was \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{found to have }\DIFdelend improved by the MTW, \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{and even to a greater extent after recalibrating the AM parameters}\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{as was the reliability of the prediction}\DIFaddend . Moreover, the \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{improvement was }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{improvements were }\DIFaddend greater for days with heavy precipitation, which are generally related to more dynamic atmospheric situations \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{where }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{in which the }\DIFaddend timing is more specific and \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{which are fewer }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{fewer records are available }\DIFaddend in the meteorological archive.

		\DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{However, in order to produce quantitative precipitation predictions the MTW requires sub-daily precipitation time series, which are generally available for a shorter period than daily precipitation archives. Therefore, two simple temporal disaggregation methods were assessed in order to make longer archives usable with the MTW. The assessed approaches were not successful, emphasizing the need to use time series with an appropriate chronology. These should be available in the near future, either by means of growing archives of measurements or by the establishment of regional precipitation reanalysis data at sub-daily time step. }%DIFDELCMD <

\DIFdel{The use of the MTW in the AM can already be considered now }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{The improvements of the analogy criterion and the performance scores on precipitation were both found to be higher for MTWs with a smaller time step  of 3 h.

A great advantage of AMs is that they create realistic precipitation patterns, since they are based on observed situations with consistent spatial distribution, as long as the analogue dates chosen for a region are the same. Moreover, they }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{AMs }\DIFaddend can provide multivariate predictions \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{that }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{which }\DIFaddend are physically consistent \citep{Raynaud2016b}.

	The method requires two different archives. The first is a meteorological archive describing the state of the atmosphere at a synoptic scale, such as reanalysis datasets\DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{, at different hours of the day}\DIFaddend . The second is an archive of the target variable to be \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{forecast, here precipitation. This archive is made of precipitation cumulated over a certain time duration, most often daily but sometimes sub-daily, }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{predicted, which is usually standard daily precipitation totals from 06:00 UTC to 06:00 UTC the following day }\DIFaddend either at a target station or integrated over a target catchment. Obviously, the period to be used is limited to the smallest period common to the two archives.

	\citet{Ruosteenoja1988} and \citet{Vandendool1994} \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{have }\DIFdelend analysed the influence of the length of the meteorological archive on the quality of the analogy. They highlighted a three-way relationship \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{between }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{among }\DIFaddend the quality of the analogy, the archive length, and the size of the spatial domain (or degrees of freedom) \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{: }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{and determined that }\DIFaddend errors increase with a \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{bigger domain , }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{larger domain }\DIFaddend but decrease with a longer archive. \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{They demonstrated that it is not possible to find good analogues over the whole northern hemisphere with a 100 year archive (and even for much higher orders of magnitude). Hopefully, it appears that for the aim of predicting precipitation over point stations or catchments of some 100 or 1000 km\texttwosuperior, there is no need to consider meteorological domains larger than 10\textdegree\ to 20\textdegree. }\DIFdelend For that reason, \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{smaller }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{limited }\DIFaddend spatial windows are always considered when searching for analogues, and the archive length is \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{maximized}\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{maximised}\DIFaddend . 

	Therefore, \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{due }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{owing }\DIFaddend to the availability of long precipitation archives at a daily time step that have no equivalent at a finer resolution, AMs are usually implemented on a daily basis. \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{Consequently, the }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{Given the cumulative aspect of the predictand, the corresponding meteorological situation is characterized by several predictors taken at different but fixed hours of the day, and the }\DIFaddend analogue situations are assessed by comparing \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{predictors at }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{these same predictors at the same }\DIFaddend fixed hours of the day. However, it can be expected that the \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{best }\DIFaddend analogy of the synoptic situations does not occur systematically at the same time of the day and that better candidates can be found by shifting to \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{a different hour}\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{different hours}\DIFaddend . With this assumption, a moving time window (MTW) was introduced to allow the search for candidates at different hours of the day. Previous tests \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{have }\DIFaddend showed the benefit, in terms of analogy criterion values, of searching for analogue synoptic situations at a finer time step, \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{but without assessing }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{although such research did not assess }\DIFaddend the impact on the prediction skill \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{\mbox{%DIFAUXCMD

	}\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{of a specific predictand \mbox{%DIFAUXCMD

	}\DIFaddend 

	\DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{The MTW finds analogue situations at different hours of the day, which can also be seen as an inflation of the archive length. However, despite having $x$ time more candidate situations, the quantity of new information is not expected to be as important as a $x$ time longer archive due to significant correlation between successive situations within the same day.
	Nevertheless, if the MTW can improve the prediction skill of the AM, it means that it does extract new information from the archive. Therefore, if the reduction of the archive length needed by the MTW, due to the reduced availability of a sub-daily precipitation time series, is expected to decrease the AM performance, the archive inflation brought by the MTW is expected to contribute to an increase in performance.

\DIFdelend Other possibilities exist for increasing the prediction skill of the AMs. A classical approach is to add new predictors or new successive levels of analogy \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{\mbox{%DIFAUXCMD
\citep[see e.g.][]{Horton2012a, BenDaoud2016, Caillouet2016}}%DIFAUXCMD
}\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{\mbox{%DIFAUXCMD
\citep[e.g.][]{Horton2012a, BenDaoud2016, Caillouet2016}}%DIFAUXCMD
}\DIFaddend . AMs can also be combined with other methods \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{\mbox{%DIFAUXCMD
\citep[see e.g.][]{Chardon2014}}%DIFAUXCMD
}\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{\mbox{%DIFAUXCMD
\citep[e.g.][]{Chardon2014}}%DIFAUXCMD
}\DIFaddend . Another possibility is to use a global optimization technique, such as genetic algorithms, in order to better optimize the method and to add new parameters \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{\mbox{%DIFAUXCMD
\citep{Horton2016}}%DIFAUXCMD
}\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{\mbox{%DIFAUXCMD
\citep{Horton2017}}%DIFAUXCMD
}\DIFaddend . However, the MTW technique is not in competition with other approaches and can be combined with \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{these. Indeed, as most of themrely on the atmospheric circulation in the first level of analogy, the application of a MTW should lead to similar conclusions}\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{them}\DIFaddend .

	\DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{The outline of this paper is as follows. }\DIFaddend Section \ref{sec:data_methods} presents the context of the study as well as the data and methods, including the proposed MTW technique. The \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{impact of the reduction of the archive and the improvements brought by the MTW are assessed in Sect. \ref{sec:results}.

	\section{Data and methods}
	\label{sec:data_methods}

	\subsection{Study area and data}
	\label{sec:data}

	The study area is the upper Rh\^{o}ne catchment in Switzerland. \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{Precipitation time series come }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{The precipitation time series were obtained }\DIFaddend from six automatic weather stations, \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{viz., }\DIFdelend Ulrichen, Zermatt, Visp, Montana, Sion, and Aigle (Fig. \ref{fig:map})\DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{, }\DIFaddend that are subject to various meteorological influences \citep{Horton2012}. The data were available at an hourly time step for \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{25~}\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{29 }\DIFaddend years (1982\textendash \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{2007}\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{2010}\DIFaddend ) and were also obtained at a \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{standard }\DIFaddend daily time step \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{(from 6}\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{of 06}\DIFaddend :00 \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{~UTC to 6}\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{UTC to 06}\DIFaddend :00 \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{~UTC the next day ) for 47~}\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{UTC the following day for 50 }\DIFaddend years (1961\textendash \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{2008). Due }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{2010). Owing }\DIFaddend to the low density of weather stations with high temporal resolution and long archives, no spatially aggregated rainfall was processed.
	\DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{The results will hereafter be presented arbitrarily for the Ulrichen station but are equivalent for all stations.
	}\DIFdelend 

	Synoptic-scale variables \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{, }\DIFdelend used as predictors \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{, }\DIFdelend were extracted from \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{the NCEP/NCAR reanalysis }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{two of the most recent global reanalysis datasets: the European Center for Medium Range Weather Forecasting 20th century reanalysis (ERA-20C) \mbox{%DIFAUXCMD

. The study was originally performed on the National Centers for Environmental Prediction/National Center for Atmospheric Research (NCEP/NCAR) reanalysis 1 dataset \mbox{%DIFAUXCMD
\citep{Kalnay1996}}%DIFAUXCMD
; the conclusions were similar. ERA-20C is built by assimilating only surface observations and is thus available for a long period (1900\textendash 2010). On the contrary, MERRA-2 is built by assimilating observations at higher levels and from more sensors including satellite data, }\DIFaddend but it is \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{not expected to affect the conclusions of the present study (see discussion in Sect. \ref{sec:old_reanalysis}) }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{more limited in time (1980\textendash present). It is of interest to assess the relevance of an MTW with these two datasets because they represent different types of products. The specific advantages of ERA-20C are that it allows for testing an MTW with a 3-h time step, and it covers a long period. On the contrary, MERRA-2 has a higher spatial resolution and can be expected to be more accurate at higher levels of the atmosphere. The variables extracted from these datasets were geopotential heights at 500 hPa (Z500) and 1000 hPa (Z1000), the total precipitable water (TPW), and the relative humidity at 850 hPa (RH850)}\DIFaddend .

	\subsection{The considered analogue \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{method}\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{methods}\DIFaddend }
	\label{sec:analog_method}

	The first considered AM is based on the analogy of \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{the }\DIFdelend atmospheric circulation only \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{\mbox{%DIFAUXCMD
\citep[Table \ref{table:method_2Z},][]{Obled2002, Bontron2005}}%DIFAUXCMD

Before searching }\DIFaddend for analogue situations \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{to }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{for }\DIFaddend a target day\DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{starts by a seasonal stratification through a preselection step }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{, seasonal stratification is conducted through preselection }\DIFaddend of the potential candidates for analogy. The \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{restriction is a search for }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{search is restricted to }\DIFaddend analogue days within a \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{4-month }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{four-month }\DIFaddend window centred on the target date for every year of the archive. The similarity of the atmospheric circulation of the target date with every day of the preselection is assessed by processing the \citet{Teweles1954} score (S1)\DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{that }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{, which }\DIFaddend is a comparison of gradients \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{on }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{of }\DIFaddend geopotential heights over a \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{certain }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{particular }\DIFaddend spatial window and at certain hours:

	\begin{equation}
	\label{eq:S1}
	S_{1}=100 \frac {\displaystyle \sum_{i}^{m} \vert \Delta\hat{z}_{i} - \Delta z_{i} \vert}
	{\displaystyle \sum_{i}^{m} max( \vert \Delta\hat{z}_{i} \vert , \vert \Delta z_{i} \vert ) } \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{,
	}\DIFaddend \end{equation}
	where $\Delta \hat{z}_{i}$ is the forecast geopotential height difference between the \textit{i}th pair of adjacent points from the grid of the target situation, $\Delta z_{i}$ is the corresponding observed geopotential height difference in the candidate situation, and $m$ is the number of pairs of adjacent points in the grid. The differences are processed separately in both directions. With smaller S1 values, there is greater similarity in the pressure fields.

	The predictor variables extracted from reanalysis datasets are considered at different hours of the day. Based on \citet{Bontron2005}, geopotential heights are compared at 1000 \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{~}\DIFdelend hPa (Z1000) at 12:00 \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{~UTC and }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{UTC and at }\DIFaddend 500 \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{~}\DIFdelend hPa (Z500) at 24:00 \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{~}\DIFdelend UTC.

Thus, the candidates are two (12-h MTW), four (6-h MTW), or eight (3-h MTW) times as many  as in the conventional approach even though they are not fully independent.

On the contrary, the days in summer showed a preference for the initial temporal window (Z500, 24 h and Z1000, 12 h). This is likely attributed to the more pronounced diurnal effects, which reduced the potential for improvement of the criteria. These effects are in phase with the daily cycle, and good analogues were essentially found for the same hours. When a 3-h MTW was used, the time step following the initial temporal window (Z500, 27 h and Z1000, 15 h) was selected almost as often as the initial values for all seasons. This temporal window can be considered as relatively similar in terms of the solar influence. The other seasons were between these two extremes, which is consistent with their respective improvements in S1.

\DIFdel{The introduction of the MTW improved the selection of synoptic analogues.

Indeed, some of those days with strong precipitation events may be documented, either qualitatively in the daily press or more quantitatively in flood reports. It is thus worth to known that the situation at hand has had such analogue in the past. Another possible application is a quality assessment of the selection of analogues on a shorter period, where precipitation data with a high temporal resolution is available. Indeed, if the selection of analogues with the MTW on the long period, for a specific target day, differ from the selection on the short period, this may point out a sub-optimal forecast.

Indeed, when the choice of the predictors or the parameters \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{are improved}\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{improve}\DIFaddend , leading to a better prediction, the optimal number of analogue situations \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{decreases}\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{tends to decrease}\DIFaddend .

	\DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{Because sub-daily precipitation time series are often available over a shorter period than daily, a reduction of the overall archive length at disposal is necessary. This usually has a negative consequence on the skill of precipitation prediction. The role of the archive length was assessed on the ERA-20C dataset and is presented in Fig. \ref{fig:plots_archive_length} for both 2Z and 2Z-2MI methods using the conventional approach of fixed 24-h windows. As expected, the performance of the method globally increased with the length of the archive. The best performances were found with a 44-year archive, which corresponds to the period 1961--2010 minus the 6 years of independent VP. This addition of 21 years of archive to the original 23 years resulted in an improvement of both 2Z and 2Z-2MI methods that was of the same order of magnitude as the introduction of a 6-h MTW (Fig. \ref{fig:plots_CRPS_2Z} and \ref{fig:plots_CRPS_2Z-2MI}). The 3-h MTW resulted in similar performance for the 2Z method and slightly superior improvements for the 2Z-2MI method.
	}

	\DIFadd{As previously stated, the MTW can be considered as an inflation of the archive because it provides additional situations to the pool of possible analogues. With the introduction of the MTW, the performance loss related to an eventual reduction of the archive length to meet the length of the sub-daily precipitation archive was indeed compensated. A 6-h MTW brought gains of the same magnitude similar to an almost double archive length. However, it should be noted that despite the number of candidate situations, which in this case is four times the original number, the gains appear to be lower than those for a quadrupled archive length. The likely reason is that an actual longer archive would contain more atmospheric situations that might have been observed less frequently during a shorter period. Moreover, rather strong serial correlations between successive sub-daily circulation patterns are expected.
	}

	\DIFadd{Many reanalysis datasets begin in the 80s owing to availability of satellite data and are thus more accurate than reanalysis datasets based on conventional data only; however, they provide shorter archives. When using such an archive, the MTW approach shows a certain potential for enriching the pool of possible analogues. Moreover, in a transient climate, the eventual nonstationarity of the link between predictors and precipitation might discard the relevance of analogues from the distant past and can increase the relevance of using a more recent and shorter archive rather than a long one. In such cases, the archive inflation brought by the MTW is also relevant.
	}

	\DIFaddend One can question the interest of using moving daily totals when\DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{6-hourly }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{, for example, 6-h }\DIFaddend precipitation series can be predicted instead. However, the \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{6-hourly }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{6-h }\DIFaddend time series generated by the AM might not \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{represent accurately }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{accurately represent }\DIFaddend the intra-daily precipitation distribution \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{(results not shown)}\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{or variability}\DIFaddend . In addition, sometimes a resolution finer than the daily time step is not needed\DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{, }\DIFaddend and another disaggregation technique may be used afterwards. Finally, when using a reconstructed precipitation archive, the errors in intra-daily precipitation distributions have a smaller impact \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{than 24h daily }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{on 24-h totals than on 6-h }\DIFaddend totals.

It would then be even more profitable to apply the MTW to the longest archive possible rather than being limited to the period in which sub-daily precipitation data are available. Therefore, the idea is to reconstruct longer archives of moving 24-h totals from existing standard daily precipitation series. For this purpose, disaggregation techniques can be used. In this study, two simple disaggregation approaches of the daily precipitation time series were assessed.
	}

	\DIFadd{The first technique is a proportional distribution in which the observed daily precipitations were considered to be constant during the measurement period of 06:00 h UTC to 06:00 h UTC the following day. The proportional parts of }\DIFaddend the \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{reanalysis dataset is rather small. This is particularly true for simple AMs that mainly rely on the atmospheric circulation, which is already well defined at a coarser resolution.

	\DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{Moreover, one can assume that the gain observed here by introducing a MTW should also be found for a better reanalysis dataset.

Data from NCEP/NCAR reanalysis 1 were used for this purpose. Precipitable water and relative humidity at 1000 hPa, 925 hPa, or 850 hPa were assessed at the four points surrounding the catchment. Precipitation time series from the reanalysis were not considered due to the presence of zeros, which may not always match the prediction; this can lead to an undefined temporal repartition. Time lapses from -12 h to +12 h between both series were introduced to consider the significant distance separating the weather stations and the reanalysis grid point. The best proxy variable, precipitable water, was identified through correlation analyses on non-zero values with the 6-h precipitation time series. When the best proxy was selected, its temporal profile was used to disaggregate the daily precipitation time series.

	The AMs are most often based on a daily time step \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{due }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{owing }\DIFaddend to the availability of long precipitation archives. However, it is unlikely that two analogue synoptic situations \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{, that }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{which }\DIFaddend evolve relatively quickly \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{, would correspond }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{would match }\DIFaddend optimally at the same hours of the day.

	As \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{\mbox{%DIFAUXCMD

}\DIFaddend , the introduction of \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{a MTW allows finding }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{an MTW enables }\DIFaddend better analogue situations in terms of \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{the atmospheric circulation . It has been demonstrated in this studythat the improvement of the }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{atmospheric circulation to be obtained.

\DIFdel{The improvement of the circulation analogy was found to be more important for days with heavier precipitation, which are generally related to more dynamic atmospheric situations and are less frequent in the archive.

Therefore, a MTW was found to be of particular interest in this kind of situation, benefiting the prediction of heavier precipitation events}\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{Moreover, the improvement in the S1 criterion increased further for smaller MTW time steps}\DIFaddend .

	A seasonal effect \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{has been highlighted , as }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{was highlighted such that }\DIFaddend the MTW was more profitable for winter than \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{summer. The reason is likely }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{for summer. A likely reason is }\DIFaddend that the diurnal cycle has a \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{bigger }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{greater }\DIFaddend effect in summer than in winter\DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{, }\DIFaddend which results in better analogues at the same time of the day. The preference for the same hours in summer has been demonstrated\DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{; whereas, 75~\% }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{, whereas a large part }\DIFaddend of the analogue situations were selected at a different time in winter.

	The \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{impact of the MTW on the prediction skill was never assessed before due to the shortcoming of long precipitation series at a sub-daily time step. Here, it was assessed for a 25~year time series with a high temporal resolution. After the introduction }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{MTW improved the precipitation prediction, with the CRPS showing a global decrease for all stations for both the CP and VP.

The results for the VP showed the same global trends but had more variability. Moreover, }\DIFaddend the \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{performance scores increased of the same magnitude as if the length of the archive doubled. }%DIFDELCMD < 

%DIFDELCMD < 	%%%
\DIFdel{The parameters were then calibrated again, using the }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{reliability of the considered AMs improved for the prediction of different threshold exceedances, especially with a 3-h }\DIFaddend MTW.
	\DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{Some parameters changed, with the main difference being the number of analogues, which systematically and significantly increased compared to the original set.

	\DIFadd{Improvements of the analogy criterion and }\DIFaddend the \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{performance scores were both found to be higher for MTWs with a smaller time step of 3 h. A 3-h MTW provided eight times more candidate situations, although they were not fully independent. Because the MTW provides additional situations to the pool of possible analogues, it can be considered as an inflation of the archive, which can be interesting in several applications.

	\DIFadd{The improvement in the circulation analogy and the change in performance of the precipitation prediction was found to be more important for days with heavier precipitation.

	The importance of the quality of the precipitation archive was also demonstrated \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{, as }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{because }\DIFaddend simplistic reconstructions of \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{6-hourly }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{sub-daily }\DIFaddend time series led to a loss of all the improvement brought by the MTW. The precipitation prediction \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{is }\DIFdelend improved only when the precipitation chronology \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{is }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{was }\DIFaddend close to the accurate \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{one}\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{values}\DIFaddend . Attempts to reconstruct longer time series based on simplistic proportional distributions or by using meteorological variables from the NCEP\DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{/NCAR }\DIFaddend reanalysis 1 dataset as \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{proxy did not succeed}\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{a proxy were not successful}\DIFaddend . Other reanalysis datasets with more accurate moisture variables could \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{eventually perform better }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{show better performance}\DIFaddend .

	The use of the MTW relies partly on the availability of long precipitation series at a sub-daily time step and with high accuracy. \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{First, these }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{The precipitation data }\DIFaddend archives of high temporal resolution \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{precipitation data are increasing }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{have increased }\DIFaddend over time. \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{Another possible source }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{Other possible sources }\DIFaddend of such archives is the establishment of precipitation reanalysis at a regional scale \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{or }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{in addition to }\DIFaddend the use of reanalysis-driven regional climate models or limited area models over a long period. Even though outputs from these models might be biased or not accurate enough, information regarding the timing of the precipitation events could be useful in disaggregating the station time series.

	\DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{Finally, since long meteorological archives (reanalysis datasets) are more and more available, the improvements proposed by the MTW especially for days with heavy precipitation may be interesting even without long continuous precipitation }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{The introduction of the MTW improved the selection of synoptic analogues. Regardless of its impact on the prediction skill for precipitation or the availability of a predictand time series with a sub-daily time step, this improvement has the potential for application to long meteorological }\DIFaddend archives. For example, \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{recent target day may have }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{when processing forecasts for a target day showing }\DIFaddend synoptic similarity with \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{known }\DIFaddend situations from the \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{early twentieth century, for which no continuous daily }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{past related to extreme weather, it can be used even if no }\DIFaddend precipitation archive is available. \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{However, some of those days with strong precipitation events may be documented, either qualitatively in the daily press or more quantitatively in flood reports. Nevertheless, }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{Thus, }\DIFaddend it is worth \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{to known that }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{knowing whether }\DIFaddend the situation at hand \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{has had such }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{had such an }\DIFaddend analogue in the \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{far past. }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{past. Another possible application is quality assessment of the selection of analogues on a shorter period, where sub-daily precipitation data are available. Indeed, if the selection of analogues with the MTW on a long period for a specific target day differs from the selection for the shorter period, a sub-optimal forecast could be identified. Finally, some other predictands might not need sub-daily total values but point observations such as hail or extreme wind gusts, which make them easier to use with the MTW.

	\DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{The use of the MTW in the AM can already be considered now }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{The technique is very simple and easily applicable. Therefore, it should be considered }\DIFaddend for several applications in different contexts, \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{may it be for }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{such as }\DIFaddend operational forecasting or climate-related studies.
